## Credits

Inspiration for this plugin came from Vincent Warmerdam's [justcharts](https://github.com/koaning/justcharts)

@facelessuser 's excellent [https://facelessuser.github.io/pymdown-extensions](pymdown-extensions) library and documentation helped making this plugin a lot easier.

And obviously [vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/docs/config.html) is an amazing library for declaritive visualizations.
